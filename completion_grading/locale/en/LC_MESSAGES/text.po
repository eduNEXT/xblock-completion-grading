"Completion grading method for the component. There are two options: minimum "
"completion and weighted completion. Minimum completion grades learners based"
" on the minimum number of completed units, if the learner has completed the "
"minimum number of units, they will get a grade of 1, otherwise 0. Weighted "
"completion grades learners based on the weighted number of completed units, "
"if the learner has completed a number of units greater or equal to the "
"number of completed units required to get a grade, they will get a grade of "
"1, otherwise the grade will be the number of completed units divided by the "
"number of completed units required to get a grade configured in the "
"component. If the value is not set, the component will use the minimum "
"completion method. The unit completions don't include the completion of the "
